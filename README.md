# chocolate-bars-project 
In this project, I attempt to analyse some chocolate bars data from Datacamp to determine whether some fields of the data can be used independently to obtain insights about the entire dataset as touching quality of the chocolate bars.
This analytics project is done as an assignment during the Women Techsters program in the Data Science and Machine Learning track, 2022 cohort.
